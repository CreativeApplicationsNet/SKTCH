## SKTCH –– Generative Drawing Tool for iOS

Instead of adopting traditional "brush" based drawing, SKTCH is about presets, created by a number of digital artists around the globe. Whether you decide to sketch circles, meshes, networks or use any of the 16 presets available, be inspired by the endless possibilities of generative sketches and compositions you are able to make using SKTCH.

### Presets

SQUARE - Simple square to get you started. Drag around the screen to see them multiply or adjust transparency to create fade effect. CIRCLE - Another simple object (similar to square). MESH - Generative mesh that connects line to previously drawn points creating a mesh style effect. Adjust the parameter to connect older points to reduce mesh extent. DEPTH AND WIDTH - Parameter created by Andres Müller, play or words, use options to set width between the letters. NETWORK - draw circles connected by centre points, size of the circle is defined by it's distance to previous point. Great preset for multitouch, creating some very unexpected but beautiful results. TRIANGLE draws beautiful generative triangles by connecting points emitted using particles. Thanks to Kim Asendorf for both ASENDORF and SIX POINTS unique presets to Kim's work. Adjust scale, span between the points and direction of pattern. JOCABOLA is a simple but beautiful preset playing with the circle resolution. Create triangles/squares/pentagons and much more. Brought to you by Eduard Prats Molner. FIREFLY also by Eduard, a particle driven preset using jocabola as the primary element. CROSS is a preset by Martin Fuchs (deffekt) allowing you to create crosses and alter their size and look. Wonderful blend of color as you draw them. KIEBITZ by Philip Whitfield (underdoeg), inspired by footprint of a bird draws amazing lines almost feeling three dimensional and last but not least two presets from Mike Tucker; PHASE a simple weave of lines and ORBIT galaxy like swarm effect.
